        Mathematics and Computing (MnC) is a fusion of Mathematics and Computer Science
        that has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline over the past few years. It
        arises out of dealing with Mathematics as a fundamental tool in computing and with
        Computing as a primary component of mathematical problem solving. The program has
        been specially designed to meet the increasing needs of professionals who would be able
        to respond to the convergence between mathematical and computational problem
        solving.
        <br><br>
        The program aims at expanding the mathematical, algorithmic and computational
        thinking of students and at providing sufficient and solid foundation for skill
        development in MnC. A strong mathematical foundation would enable the study and
        analysis of abstract concepts and to model many real life problems mathematically,
        algorithmic thinking would provide ways to solve these mathematical problems in an
        automated way and computational thinking would allow for evaluating the efficiency of
        these solutions. The program aims to provide exposure to the students who wish to
        build a professional career in MnC, working at the cutting edge of technology, research
        and development. On successful completion of the program, the students would have
        acquired essential theoretical, technical and practical knowledge for solving real-world
        problems, and will have the ability to demonstrate excellent analytical, logical and
        problem solving skills. The students would have also acquired social and ethical
        attributes that would enable them in applying their skills for societal needs with
        effective communication both orally and in writing.

                        and logic. Everything in OOP is grouped as self-sustainable objects.

                        Data Structures and Algorithms are made from two separate words- Data Structures and second is
                        Algorithms. Data Structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our
                        devices to use the data efficiently and effectively, and Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure
                        or a set of rules followed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It's a
                        well-defined sequence of instructions designed to take an input, process it through a series of
                        computational steps, and produce the desired output. We will see how to use Data Structures
                        nicely in various problems and also see how to make efficient algorithms for given problems. And
                        see some optimized algorithms like sorting, searching, etc…

                        Linear algebra can be defined as a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of linear
                        functions in vector spaces. When information related to linear functions is presented in an
                        organized form then it results in a matrix. Thus, linear algebra is concerned with vector
                        spaces, vectors, linear functions, the system of linear equations, and matrices.

                        components like processes, memory, I/O, and file systems are studied in detail. We also study
                        the implementation of these constructs in the context of a basic Unix-like operating system. In
                        the laboratory, experiments/assignments cover: system programming in Unix-like OS,
                        multithreading, and concurrency control. At the end of the course, students are expected to have
                        an in-depth understanding of a modern OS architecture and be able to understand and implement
                        programs using system calls.

                        <b>3. Data Structures and Algorithms :-</b> Data Structures and Algorithms is made from two separate words- Data Structures and second is Algorithms. Data Structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively and Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules followed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It's a well-defined sequence of instructions designed to take an input, process it through a series of computational steps, and produce the desired output. We will see how to use Data Structures nicely in various problems and also see how to make efficient algorithms for given problems. And see some optimized algorithms like sorting, searching, etc…

We look at the structure of a modern operating system, and the design of its components. Important components like processes, memory, I/O, and file systems are studied in detail. We also study the implementation of these constructs in the context of a basic Unix-like operating systems. In the laboratory, experiments/assignments cover: system programming in Unix-like OS, multithreading, and concurrency control. At the end of the course, students are expected to have an in-depth understanding of a modern OS architecture and be able to understand and implement programs using system calls.
